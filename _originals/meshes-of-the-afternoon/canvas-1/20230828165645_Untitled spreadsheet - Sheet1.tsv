16		Here we get the first glimpse at something important to understanding the artist’s play with shadow in that the form already is chosen in Black & White film.	Background	
28		We are specifically seeing a shadow of the woman first, an indirect showcase of what the woman is doing— leading us to think about the difference between what Deren would want between showing the woman versus the shadow.	Shadow	
30		Shadow reaches for the flower, and it combines the shot of showing the shadow and the real hand coming together as she gets closer to the flower. However, the intention of making the shadow go for the flower first catches the eye.	Shadow	
40		The camera focuses on the shadow of her walking, not the actual figure.	Shadow	
1:26		The shadow and hand together show that the double meaning could rely on both her shadow as a version of herself, in the spell of this life or dream, but also the important of how shadow is created: light being thrown on you. This connects with themes in the life of this woman being watched.	Shadow	
3:30		When going to find the mirror-faced person, it is her shadow attempting to make contact that we see. Yes, we are prompted to think of this as the real person, so the question becomes the difference in its intention as an experimental film technique, yet also a very intentional artistic meaning to what the character is feeling.

11:40		She creeps up upon the bed, then seeing her shadow on the pillow. However, as the shadow closes towards the mirror, the man appears instead of her. This indicates that the role of the woman’s shadow is not necessarily just an extension of herself, but something curated by someone else and inflicted upon her.	Shadow	
12:55		Now, after the mirror had been broken once she found out who the shadow was, we see the film focus on the shadow of the man. This could lead to many interpretations, but the two large ones being: one, he also has his own shadow to deal with, or two, that it was meant to connect him once again to the role of the shadow, telling us that the role of a man in this relationship is tied to that creation or mystery of the shadow.
