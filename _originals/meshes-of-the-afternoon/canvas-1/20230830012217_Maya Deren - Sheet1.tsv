16		Here we get the first glimpse at something important to understanding the artist’s play with shadow in that the form already is chosen in Black & White film.	Background	
28		We are specifically seeing a shadow of the woman first, an indirect showcase of what the woman is doing— leading us to think about the difference between what Deren would want between showing the woman versus the shadow.	Shadows	
30		Shadow reaches for the flower, and it combines the shot of showing the shadow and the real hand coming together as she gets closer to the flower. However, the intention of making the shadow go for the flower first catches the eye.	Shadows	
40		The camera focuses on the shadow of her walking, not the actual figure.	Shadows	
1:26		The shadow and hand together show that the double meaning could rely on both her shadow as a version of herself, in the spell of this life or dream, but also the important of how shadow is created: light being thrown on you. This connects with themes in the life of this woman being watched.	Shadows	
3:30		When going to find the mirror-faced person, it is her shadow attempting to make contact that we see. This then adds a strange layer to the understanding that comes together at the end, as it is specifically the shadow-mirror-creature that the shadow of the woman attempts to make contact, as large points in the film point to the shadow being largely affected by the role of the man, and it almost brings a sense of familiarity when looking back on this scene, as the shadows would both-- if, like we saw at the beginning with the man walking into the distance, we accept that the shadow-mirror-creature is also created or affected by the man-- be the same created part of her by the man. 	Shadows	
11:40		We see a shadow on the bed, creeping towards the mirror. It turns out to be the man, and we get another small indication that the connection between the shadows in the film and the man, now seeing the last type of shadow, the pure use of shadow. It seems to highlight largely what the woman was feeling in her need to commit suicide, the lack of control, the dominance and colonization of the man within her. 	Shadows	
12:55		Now, after the mirror had been broken once she found out who the shadow-mirror-creature was, we see the film focus on the shadow of the man. This could lead to many interpretations, but the two large ones being: one, he also has his own shadow to deal with, or two, that it was meant to connect him once again to the role of the shadow, telling us that the role of a man in this relationship is tied to that creation or mystery of the shadow.	Shadows	
34		What is important to remember for us is that it is her, and her shadow, that initally pick up the flower. This will be important for our introduction into the mirror-faced, shadow-like creature.  	Background	
46		A very dark silhouette of a man is seen, it is important to remember that this is the first character the woman sees.  	Background	
3:17		Now we see a shadow-like creature enter the frame after the woman falls asleep and begins to dream. The character is dressed in all black, almost confusing itself as a nun. The shadow-mirror-creature is also seen here carrying the flower, the same flower that both the shadow of the woman and the woman picked up before the dream started. 	Shadow-Mirror-Creature	
3:52		The shadow-mirror-creature is now seen walking off beyond the corner, just like the silhouette of the man was at the beginning of the film. This then signals the start of the cyclical nature of the film. This is also important for us to remember when connecting the idea of the woman's shadow and the man at the end of the story. This is the largest part in the film that pushes me to believe that both shadows are created or affected by the man. 	Shadow-Mirror-Creature	
6:32		We see the shadow-mirror-creature again, in the same spot, repeating the cycle once again. 	Shadow-Mirror-Creature	
7:00		The shadow-mirror-creature is now inside the house, not seen in their typical cyclical path down the street. Heading up the stairs, the creature places a flower on the bed. This change deeply affects the woman, as she is about to start loosing control of her place. The interesting part of this is it begins to allude that maybe after the woman's painting over the ceiling of the place, that now what we see, the part of the woman that is moving and not asleep, might even be the shadow of the woman. Her inability to choose her movement in the frames following the flower being put on the bed add up to this in that much of how we view shadows in their relationship to ourselves is that they are entirely dependent on, or trapped by, our decisions and movement. 	Woman-Shadow	
8:39		Back to the original cycle, we see the shadow-mirror-creature again. Here is where it became more obvious to me, another connection: her inability to catch the shadow-mirror-creature. This reminds me of the idea that you cannot truly touch your shadow, as by the time you touch the ground, or wherever the shadow might be, it is gone. 	Shadow-Mirror-Creature	
10:00		As all the versions, or shadows, of the woman come to the table to pick up the key, they all seem to fail except the newest one, whose hand turns black after picking up the key. Both the inability to pick up the key, as well as the blackened hand when picking it up, seem to indicate that these versions of the woman are shadows. So, going forward it might need to be more clear on what the difference between these two are. 	Woman-Shadow	
10:50		As the shadow goes to stab the sleeping version of herself, she seems to wake up and instead of her shadow standing there to kill her, it is the man. 	Woman-Shadow	
11:00		He happens to be holding the flower. \	Background	
11:29		The man places the flower on the bed, exactly like the shadow-mirror-creature did minutes before. This ties again the aspect we saw at the very beginning of the film, linking the man to the silhouette walking down the street. This is now the second time that one of the shadows in the film connects to the man. First, the "woman-shadow" when going to kill the woman sleeping, and now the "shadow-mirror-creature," both at the beginning walking down the street and now in placing the flower on the bed.
