This change deeply affects the woman, as she is about to start loosing control of her place. The interesting part of this is it begins to allude that maybe after the woman's painting over the ceiling of the place, that now what we see, the part of the woman that is moving and not asleep, might even be the shadow of the woman. Her inability to choose her movement in the frames following the flower being put on the bed add up to this in that much of how we view shadows in their relationship to ourselves is that they are entirely dependent on, or trapped by, our decisions and movement.
